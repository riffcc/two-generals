# Palace Request
Analyze this project and suggest possible next actions.

Consider what exists, what's in progress, and what could come next.
Check SPEC.md and ROADMAP.md if they exist.

Provide as many options as you see fit - there may be many valid paths forward.
Be concrete and actionable. The user will select which action(s) to execute.
